# Atlas-Replay -- Continual atlas-based segmentation (WACV 2024)

This repository represents the official PyTorch code base for our WACV 2024 published paper **Continual atlas-based segmentation of prostate MRI**. Our code exclusively utilizes the PyTorch version of the [VoxelMorph](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph) framework as its foundation. For more details, please refer to our paper at [insert paper link].

## Introduction

This WACV 2024 submission currently includes the following methods for Continual Learning:
* Sequential Training
* Rehearsal Training
* Riemannian Walk
* Elastic Weight Consolidation
* Bias Correction
* Incremental Learning Techniques

## Installation

The simplest way to install all dependencies is by using [Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html):

1. Create a Python 3.9 environment as `conda create -n <your_conda_env> python=3.9` and activate it as `conda activate  <your_conda_env>`.
2. Install CUDA and PyTorch through conda with the command specified by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The command for Linux was at the time `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch`. Our code was last tested with version 1.13. Pytorch and TorchVision versions can be specified during the installation as `conda install pytorch==<X.X.X> torchvision==<X.X.X> cudatoolkit=<X.X> -c pytorch`. Note that the cudatoolkit version should be of the same major version as the CUDA version installed on the machine, e.g. when using CUDA 11.x one should install a cudatoolkit 11.x version, but not a cudatoolkit 10.x version.
3. Navigate to the project root (where `setup.py` lives).
4. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages.


## How to get started?
- Since our code base follows the VoxelMorph Framework, the models with Continual Learning methods are trained in the same fashion.
- If the VoxelMorph U-Net should be used for simple segmentation, please use the `--seg` flag, an example train script can be found [here](https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/Atlas-Replay/tree/main/scripts/torch/train_abstract_unet.py).
- The easiest way to start is using our `train_abstract_*.py` python files. For every baseline and Continual Learning method, we provide specific `train_abstract_*.py` python files, located in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/Atlas-Replay/tree/main/scripts/torch).
- The [eval folder](https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/Atlas-Replay/tree/main/eval) contains several jupyter notebooks that were used to calculate performance metrics and plots used in our submission.


## Data, splits and pre-trained models
- **Data**: In our paper, we used seven publicly available prostate datasets where inter-subject samples are rigidly aligned using [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/):
  - [Multi-site Dataset for Prostate MRI Segmentation](https://liuquande.github.io/SAML/)
  - [Prostate Dataset from the Medical Decathlon Challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ff7c21UksxyT4JfETjaarmuKEjdqe1-a/view?usp=share_link)
- **Splits**: The train and test splits which were used during training for all methods can be found in the [misc folder](https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/Atlas-Replay/tree/main/misc) of this repository.
- **Models**: Our pre-trained models from our submission can be provided by contacting the [main author](mailto:amin.ranem@gris.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de) upon request.
- **Prototypes**: Our generated prototypes along with the preprocessed dataset can be requested [per mail](mailto:amin.ranem@gris.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de).
